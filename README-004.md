    ---------------------------------------

2. Write a Python function to check whether a string is pangram or not.

        Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
        For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

    Hint: Look at the string module

3. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

    ```
    Sample String : 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
    Expected Output : 
    No. of Upper case characters : 4
    No. of Lower case Characters : 33
    ```
